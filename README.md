#  **Travel Journal (React Basics Project)**

This is a small React project called **Travel Journal**.  
It helps beginners understand the basics of **React components, props, and rendering lists**.

---

##  **What I Learned**

1. **Header Component** – Created a simple header for the app.  
2. **Entry Component** – Made a reusable component to show each travel place.  
3. **Props (Properties)** – Passed data like `title`, `location`, `image`, etc. into the component.  
4. **Destructuring Props** – Wrote shorter code by unpacking props inside the component.  
5. **Non-string Props** – Passed numbers and booleans as props (not just text).  
6. **Importing Images** – Used local images inside the project.  
7. **Array `.map()`** – Learned how to loop through an array and show multiple entries.  
8. **Key Prop** – Added a unique `key` for each item when using `.map()`.  
9. **Pass Object as Props** – Sent the whole object as props instead of sending each field.  
10. **Spread Operator (`...`)** – Used `...object` to pass all object values easily.

✅ Save this as **`README.md`** and push it to GitHub — it will display properly with **bold headings, lists, and code formatting**.  

Do you also want me to **add a short code snippet example** (like `Entry.jsx` + `.map()` in `App.jsx`) inside this README so beginners can quickly see how it works?
